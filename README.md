# Discord Bot – Gene Kerman

A modular, non-production-ready Discord bot built with **discord.py 2.x** designed for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) communities. Features a fully-fledged economy, corporation system, contracts, weekly missions, and AI-powered screenshot analysis.

## Features

| Category | Description / Commands |
|---|---|
| **Contracts** | Player-to-player and AI contract system (`/contract create`, `/contracts`) |
| **Weekly Missions** | AI-generated weekly challenges with difficulty tiers |
| **Corporations** | Create and manage corps, private channels (`/g corpsetup`, `/g corp`) |
| **Economy** | KCoins currency, balances, payments (`/balance`, `/pay`, `/leaderboard`) |
| **XP System** | Leveling system with rewards for chatting and completing missions |
| **Screenshots** | AI analysis of KSP screenshots using Gemini AI to detect celestial bodies and mods (`/analyze`) |
| **GKChannels** | Gate bot commands to specific channels (`/gk setchannel`) |
| **Admin/Mod** | General moderation, announcements, localization settings, and configuration |

All commands are available as **slash commands** (`/`).

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone / open the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KSPRehber/UPoK-DCBot.git genekerman
cd genekerman
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment & install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure environment variables and settings

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env   # fill in your values
```

You must configure:
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Bot token from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Firebase Admin SDK credentials JSON (for Firestore database)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: For AI contract reviews and screenshot analysis

**Note:** Economy rates, cooldowns, XP curves, and feature toggles (like allowing mods to bypass weekly mission locks) can be safely adjusted in `settings.py`.

### 4. Run the bot

```bash
# Don't forget to activate the virtual environment!
source .venv/bin/activate
python bot.py --sync
```

## Security & Architecture Notes

- `.env` and Firebase credentials are **never** committed — ensure they are in `.gitignore`.
- All persistent data (balances, users, contracts, guilds) is stored in **Firebase Firestore**.
- Mod-only commands are permission-gated via Discord's native Role/Permissions system.
