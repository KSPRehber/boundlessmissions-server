class RescueTarget(BaseModel):
    """Where stranded kerbals must be recovered from / delivered to.

    mode == "orbit"   → ap/pe define the target orbit (metres above the body
                        surface); margin_alt is the allowed +/- on each.
    mode == "surface" → lat/lon define the landing spot (degrees); margin_pos is
                        the allowed great-circle tolerance (degrees).
    is_modded is flagged by the issuer's client (it scans the real body list).

    `mode` is where; `recovery` is *what* has to get there:
        "crew"   → the stranded kerbals, aboard whatever ship brought them. The
                   wreck may be stripped, abandoned or destroyed.
        "vessel" → the crew and the wreck itself, towed or flown home. Verified by
                   part flightID (KSP keeps a part's uid across export, import and
                   docking), so the wreck stays identifiable however it gets back.
    min_dv is a floor in m/s on the delivering craft's remaining vacuum delta-v, so
    the crew are dropped somewhere they can actually leave from. 0 = no requirement.
    Both default to the pre-existing behaviour, which is what every rescue issued
    before these modes existed had.

    In "orbit" mode the issuer may also constrain the *shape and plane* of the
    target orbit, which ap/pe alone say nothing about:
        inc / margin_inc → required inclination in degrees, ± tolerance. margin_inc
                           <= 0 (the default) means any plane. Matching the wreck's
                           plane is the expensive half of a rendezvous, so this is
                           what turns "be at 100×100 km" into a real intercept.
        orbit_types      → canonical regime tokens ("polar", "equatorial",
                           "stationary", …) from data/orbit_constraints.REQUIREMENTS,
