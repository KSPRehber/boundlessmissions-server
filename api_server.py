    caches only — guild.get_member and the in-memory store — never fetch_member: this
    endpoint is one round trip per picker open, and N members * one Discord fetch each
    would turn that into a multi-second stall on a large guild. A member missing from
    the cache simply comes back without an avatar, which the client renders as initials.

    owner_name is resolved the same way, and for a second reason as well as staleness:
    a picker is a list of *people*, so it must show the name they are known by here —
    nick, then global name, then handle, which is exactly discord.py's display_name.
    That is the name every other surface uses (a link code is issued under it, so is a
    weekly mission's contractor), and the picker was the one place still printing raw
    account handles. The stored value is the fallback for anyone the cache has no
    member for — someone who has left, or a shard that has not filled yet.

# ── Friends ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A quicksend is a hand-over, not a broadcast: `kind="vessel"` removes the ship
# and its crew from the sender's save the moment this server confirms. The picker
# behind it used to be `/api/v1/corps/list` — everyone in the guild — which made
# the recipient of that hand-over anyone at all. It is now the friend list, and
# the *server* is where that is enforced: a client is free to draw whatever list
# it likes, but `/api/v1/craft/send` asks `friends_db.are_friends` before it
# stores a byte.
#
# Everything below is written once and mounted twice — the KSP tier
# (`get_current_user_onboarded`) and the website tier (`get_web_user`) — because
# `_require_audience` deliberately forbids one dependency serving both, and two
# copies of a mutual-consent flow would be two chances for the halves to differ.
# The card resolver is shared with the corps picker's reasoning: names and
# avatars are resolved at read time from caches, never stored on a friendship,
# for the reason the transaction ledger gives — a display name changes, and a
# baked-in copy is wrong forever.

# Where to deliver something to a player who is not the caller.
#
# Both the notification feed (`guilds/{gid}/ksp_notifications/…`) and the craft
# import queue (`guilds/{gid}/ksp_craft_imports/…`) are keyed by guild, and every
# writer used to pass the guild of its own token. That agreed with the reader for
# as long as the only people you could send to were in your own server —
# `imports.queue_guild` already had to correct it for website accounts, whose
# token guild is always the home guild. Friendship is guild-independent by
# construction, so two Discord players who met in different servers can now be
# friends, and a hand-over written under the sender's guild would land in a queue
# the recipient never polls. For a live vessel that is not a lost message: the
# ship has already left the sender's save.
#
# So the recipient's own session record — which `create_session_token` writes on
# every link — is asked where they actually read. Fails back to the caller's
# guild, which is exactly the old behaviour and right for the common case where
# the two are the same.

    decoded uid must be *this* account's — a valid token for somebody else proves
    nothing about the person at the keyboard here.

    An account with **no Firebase identity at all** is exempt. A Discord-origin
    account (`accounts.ensure_discord_account`) has no `firebase_uid` — the only
    writer of that field is `join_accounts` — and signs in through the link-code

    i.e. remove 2FA from most of the player base, on the accounts where it is least
    decorative (`_maybe_totp_link_challenge` gates the KSP link flow on it).

    **Be clear about what that exemption costs**, because it is a knowing trade and
    not a proof: for those accounts, enrolling a second factor needs only a valid
    session. That is exactly the AU3 attack — somebody holding a borrowed live
    session enrols their own authenticator, keeps the recovery codes, and the owner
    cannot remove it because both removal paths require a code. A session token is
    up to 30 days old, so "they signed in once" is not freshness and must not be
    read as one. What makes the trade acceptable is only that the damage is now
    recoverable rather than permanent: `admin_user_clear_2fa` (owner-only, audited)
    exists precisely for this, and it did not before.

    The proper close is a fresh **Discord DM confirmation** for these accounts —
    `create_approval_challenge` / `_dm_login_approval` / `resolve_approval` already
    do exactly this shape for the link flow, so it is a wiring job plus a client
    round trip, not new machinery. Until that is built, this is a documented gap and

# ── Web → game commands ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The website can ask the caller's own running KSP to raise a window. It travels
# down the notification socket the client already holds, addressed to one account.
#
# Two rules hold this surface in place, and both are deliberate:
#
#   1. **Commands may only raise UI.** Contract actions go over HTTP and are
#      authorized against the account like any other request. A command is
#      different: it reaches into a running game process, where no per-action
#      authorization is possible on the receiving end. So the allow-list stays
#      UI-only. Something irreversible needs a stronger auth tier, not a bigger
#      allow-list — `/api/v1/web/*` is token-only, with no device binding and no
#      mod-version gate, because a browser has no DLL to hash.
#   2. **The frame carries an id, never terms.** The mod re-reads the mission
#      type, situation, body, mod list and constraints from /contracts/active,
#      so a caller here cannot quietly relax a contract's own requirements.
#
# Free by construction: the socket is closed while data sharing is off, so no
# command can arrive at an opted-out client.

#  Admin API (/api/v1/web/admin/...)
#

#
#  - `get_owner`: the single BOT_OWNER_ID from .env — the same one person
#    cogs/perms.is_owner_user trusts. Guards everything bot-wide: user accounts
#    (balance, suspensions, deletion), DM-from-bot, DLL publishing, costs,
#    runtime gates and policy — because a role granted in one guild must never
#    carry authority over every guild the bot is in.
#  - `get_admin`: the owner, or a holder of a guild's mapped bot-admin role
#    (guild_config key "admin", set per guild via /admin setrole — guild
#    administrators are still NOT auto-admins, matching is_admin_user). Guards
#    the guild-scoped moderation surface (overview, listings, announcements,
#    channel locks), and every response and action is scoped to the guilds the
#    caller actually admins.
#
#  Both answer 404 (not 403) to anyone else, so the surface is invisible to a
#  probing outsider with a valid session. The website only *hides* tabs
#  client-side; these dependencies are the actual gate.
