"""Contract interactive button views.

All buttons use DynamicItem with regex-matched custom_ids so they
survive bot restarts. Contract/guild info is encoded in the custom_id:
"prefix:contract_id:guild_id"

**These buttons do not implement contract transitions.** Every one of them calls
`contract_actions`, which is also what the KSP mod's HTTP endpoints call, and then
renders the outcome. Buttons decide what the message looks like; that module decides
what happens. See its docstring for why the two used to disagree.

Authorization is now passed explicitly rather than inferred from where the view was
delivered. That matters because not every view lands in a DM: `ContractWorkView` is
posted to a public corp channel by the weekly-mission flow, and `ModReviewView` lands
in a dispute ticket both parties can see.
