"""
cogs/contracts.py – Player-to-player contract system (Discord side).

Contracts are **created in the KSP mod or on the website**, never here: the old
`/contract` and `/flagcontract` commands were retired because a contract written
from Discord could not carry the half that matters — the craft on the build stage,
the mod list, the orbit and Δv margins a mission is judged against. What is left
here is the part Discord is actually good at: the offer/dispute/review buttons that
land in a DM (see `cogs/contract_views.py`), the mod clean-up tool, and the rescue
leaderboard. `contract_actions.py` is the shared service all front ends call.
