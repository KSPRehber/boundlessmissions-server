"""
cogs/corps.py – Corporation system.

Users can establish a corporation which creates a dedicated text channel.
Each user may own one corporation at a time. Data is persisted in Firestore.

Firestore path: guilds/{guild_id}/corps/{user_id}

**A corp is never created just because someone joined the Discord server.** A corp
channel is a private channel carrying that player's contract traffic, deliveries
and dispute hand-offs — creating one the moment a member arrives spends a channel
on everybody who only ever came to read, and it stores their name and avatar in a
channel topic and a pinned embed before they have agreed to anything. So the
trigger is the in-mod consent gate instead: the KSP client transmits *nothing*
until the player accepts the privacy policy and terms (`Consent.Accepted` /
`ApiClient.TransmissionBlocked`), which makes a completed link the server's proof
that they did. `ensure_corp_for_linked_user` is called from the link endpoints and
is the only automatic path left; `/corpsetup` (explicit) and `/admin corpsgenerate`
(backfill, linked members only) are the others.
