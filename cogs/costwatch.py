"""
cogs/costwatch.py – Keeps the cost guard fed, and tells the owner before the wall.

Two jobs, on one loop:

  • POLL. Every `settings.COST_METRICS_POLL_INTERVAL` seconds, fetch Google's own
    usage figures from Cloud Monitoring and hand them to `cost_guard.ingest_usage`
    as the authoritative baseline. This is what closes the estimator's blind
    spots — signed-URL egress, bytes at rest, and any usage that isn't this
    process (scripts, the console, a second instance on the same project).
    Far more slowly (`COST_BILLING_POLL_INTERVAL`, six hours) it also reads the
    BigQuery billing export for the actual invoice — display only, and quiet,
    since that source is hours behind and cannot be allowed near the brake.

  • ANNOUNCE. Every `_TICK` seconds, drain whatever threshold crossings the guard
    has queued and DM them to the owner. Previously the only sign a budget had
    blown was a log line, which meant finding out from users. Alerts are drained
    on a much shorter cycle than the poll, because a level can change instantly
    from the local meter and hearing about a freeze five minutes late is no good.

WHY THE GUARD QUEUES AND THIS COG DISPATCHES
`cost_guard` is imported by data/store.py and runs on whatever thread happens to
be doing a Firestore call — inside firebase-admin's synchronous internals, off
the event loop. That is no place to touch Discord. So the guard appends to a
list under its lock and this cog, which does live on the loop, drains it.
