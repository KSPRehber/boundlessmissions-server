"""
cogs/perms.py – Permission helpers that are mimic-safe.

The admin "mimic" system (see bot.py) swaps `interaction.user` to the mimicked
target *before* command/view checks run. If a permission check reads the swapped
`interaction.user`, an admin who mimics a higher-privileged user (e.g. the bot
owner) would borrow that user's authority — a privilege escalation.

`real_user()` unwraps that swap: permission checks MUST gate on the *real*
invoker, so mimic only changes business-logic identity, never the authority a
command is gated on. The real user is stashed by the mimic patch in
`interaction.extras["_mimic_real_user"]`.
