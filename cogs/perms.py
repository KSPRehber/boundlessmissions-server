cogs/perms.py – Permission helpers that are mimic-safe.

The admin "mimic" system (see bot.py) swaps `interaction.user` to the mimicked
target *before* command/view checks run. If a permission check reads the swapped
`interaction.user`, an admin who mimics a higher-privileged user (e.g. the bot
owner) would borrow that user's authority — a privilege escalation.

`real_user()` unwraps that swap: permission checks MUST gate on the *real*
invoker, so mimic only changes business-logic identity, never the authority a
command is gated on. The real user is stashed by the mimic patch in
`interaction.extras["_mimic_real_user"]`.

# ── The tier that writes GLOBAL records ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# `is_mod_user` above ends in `kick_members or administrator`, so anyone holding
# either in a guild the bot is in passes it with no bot-side configuration at all.
# That is right for what it was written for — kick, ban, mute, and the other
# guild-local actions in cogs/moderation.py, which act on guild membership and
# whose authority genuinely is a Discord permission.
#
# It is wrong for the five commands that write records the whole product shares:
# /givemoney, /fine, /setbalance (the global `users/{id}` wallet), /setxp and
# /contractreset (the global contract collection). There the fallback means the
# mod tier is *self-granted* — obtaining it takes no more than a server where you
# hold administrator, which until guild_gate landed meant any server at all.
#
# `moderatable_here` already bounds *who* such a moderator may act on: the target
# has to be a member of the guild they are moderating in. This bounds the other
# half — that the authority itself has to have been handed over deliberately,
# rather than inferred from a Discord permission nobody granted with the shared
# economy in mind. So: the bot owner, or a holder of the guild's **mapped** mod or
# admin role (/admin setrole), and nothing else.
#
# The admin role counts for the mod tier because it is strictly the higher of the
# two (`is_admin_user` gates the guild-scoped console surface); an admin who could
# not run a mod command would be a rung missing from the middle of the ladder.

    document the whole product reads (`data/store.py`: "guild_id is accepted for
