"""
cogs/tickets.py – Private support / report tickets.

A persistent "📩 Open a Ticket" button lives in TICKET_PANEL_CHANNEL_ID. Pressing
it shows a reason dropdown (report a user / report a bug / other), then a short
modal. On submit, a private channel is created under TICKET_CATEGORY_ID that only
the filer and the mods (MOD_ROLE_ID) can see — no outside access.

Other flows reuse `create_ticket()` to open tickets programmatically:
  • KSP account-sharing reports  (cogs/ksp_bridge.py)
  • Contract "sue" escalations    (cogs/contract_views.py)
  • In-game bug reports           (api_server.py, /api/v1/bugreport) — these ping
    the `bug_report` role instead of the mods, see `notify_role_key` below.

Each ticket channel carries a "🔒 Close" button (mods or the opener may close).
The opener's id is stored in the channel topic so the close check survives a
bot restart.
