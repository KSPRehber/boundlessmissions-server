contract_actions.py — the one implementation of every contract state transition.

Why this file exists
────────────────────
Every transition was written twice: once as an HTTP endpoint in `api_server.py` for
the KSP mod, once as a Discord button in `cogs/contract_views.py`. The two copies had
different authorization stories and had drifted on what the transition actually *does*.

The authorization story on the Discord side was **delivery**: `ContractOfferView` is
attached to a DM, so `interaction.user` had to be the contractor and no explicit check
was needed. That is implicit, and it had already broken — `ContractWorkView`
(Give Up / Submit) is also posted to a *public corp channel* by the weekly-mission flow
(`cogs/weeklymissions.py`), where the Give Up button carried no actor check at all.
`ModReviewView` likewise lands in a dispute ticket that both disputing parties can see
and type in.

The behavioural drift, all verified against the two implementations before this file
was written:

  • **Give Up** — the API charges the agreed fine and pays the issuer fine+payment.
    The Discord button charged nothing and merely refunded escrow, so backing out was
    free on Discord and expensive in game.
  • **Refuse offer / Pay fine** — the Discord buttons had no status check, so pressing
    one a second time on a closed contract re-ran the payout.
  • **Rescue approval** — the API hands the craft and the rescued kerbals back to the
    issuer (`_deliver_rescue_craft`). The Discord review button did not, so approving a
    rescue from Discord left the crew nowhere.
  • **Rescue failure** — the API restores the issuer's stranded vessel on cancel and on
    pay-fine. No Discord path did, so the issuer's ship stayed deleted with nothing
    given back.
  • **Bot-issued contracts** — the API skips crediting a bot issuer; the Discord buttons
    paid coins into the bot's own wallet.
  • **Notifications** — the API tells the other party so their in-game contract list
    refreshes live; the Discord buttons told nobody.

So: one function per transition. It takes the acting user as an **explicit argument**
rather than inferring authority from the transport, performs every side effect
(Firestore, balances, notifications, rescue delivery, the Discord hand-off views), and
returns a plain `Result` the caller renders however it likes. Front ends decide
*presentation*; this file decides *what happens*.

Adding a front end (the public website, in Phase 6a) therefore adds no new copy.

One deliberate behaviour change
───────────────────────────────
`cancel` used to let the **contractor** cancel an *active* contract, which closed it
with no fine — making `give_up`'s fine entirely optional and the penalty decorative.
A contractor may now only cancel while the contract is still `pending` (declining an
offer they never accepted); backing out after accepting goes through `give_up` and
costs the agreed fine. The issuer keeps the old behaviour, since withdrawing an offer
refunds only their own escrow.

    Submission normally lives in the mod, because what a review is judged against —

    A flag is the one deliverable that is *only* an image, so it has no in-game
    upload and never had one: it was a Discord button, and this is that button's
    body with the Discord parts taken out, so the website can offer the same act.

    Two things are load-bearing and were not true of the Discord copy this replaces.
    The flip is `claim_submission`, the same transactional ACTIVE→SUBMITTED the craft
    path uses: real I/O (two Storage uploads) happens between reading the status and
    writing it, and a plain `update` would put SUBMITTED over a contract that was
    cancelled or given up in that window — whose escrow is already refunded — so the
    review that followed would pay it a second time. And the issuer gets a `_notify`
    as well as the Discord embed, so their in-game contract list refreshes; the
    Discord path told only Discord, which is why a flag submitted there was invisible
    to a player reviewing from the sidebar.

    """Pause (or resume) a contract's clock around a service suspension.

    Submitting is a KSP-only action, and a suspension refuses exactly the KSP API. The
    two sweepers below did not know that, so a suspension quietly ran the overdue clock
    and then the dispute clock and collected the full fine — up to
    MAX_ACTIVE_CONTRACTS_PER_USER of them — turning what the shortfall could not cover
    into a garnished debt that follows the player afterwards. A four-day suspension was
    therefore a fine on every contract they held.

    That directly contradicts what a suspension is documented to be, in `data/suspensions.py`
    ("not a wipe: balance, XP, contracts and listings are untouched and waiting") and in
    the notice the mod draws for it ("nothing was deleted"). It was also unavoidable: the
    exits a contractor has — give up, pay the fine — take the same money, and the only
    action that would have saved them is the one the suspension blocks.

    So the clock stops instead. `clock_paused_at` is stamped the first time a sweep sees
    the contractor suspended, and the elapsed time is added back to the deadline when a
    later sweep sees them free. Driven entirely from the sweeps, so it needs no hook on
    the unsuspend path and self-corrects if one is ever missed — including for a
    suspension that expired on its own clock, which nothing announces.

    Reads FAIL OPEN, exactly as `data/suspensions.py` does: a Firestore blip must not
    freeze every deadline in the system. The cost of failing open is the pre-existing
    behaviour for one sweep pass.

    Corp channels are private (owner + members + mods), so this is no less
    confidential than a DM — but unlike a DM it works for players who block DMs,
    and it keeps a player's contract paperwork in one place. A channel post does
    not notify by itself, so the player is mentioned; the DM fallback drops the
    mention, which is redundant there. Returns the sent message, or None when
    neither surface worked.

    A player who has turned corp pings off (`store.corp_pings_enabled`, set from
    the mod's Settings panel) still gets the mention *text* — the post has to say
    who it is addressed to, and a corp channel has other members reading it — but
    it is sent with `allowed_mentions=none`, so Discord does not notify them. The
    message itself is never withheld: every caller pairs this with `_notify`, so
    the in-game feed carries it either way, and dropping the Discord copy would
    hide a contract from the mods and corp members who can also see the channel.
    The DM fallback is untouched: a DM is the delivery, not a ping, and it is only
    ever reached when there is no corp channel to have posted in.
