"""
cost_guard.py – Spend tracking and the spending brake for the paid Google services.

The bot depends on two metered Google products:

  • Gemini   – AI screenshot / mission / contract analysis.
  • Firebase – Firestore (every XP write, every contract) + Storage (craft files).

THREE TIERS, FOR THREE DIFFERENT JOBS
-------------------------------------
No single source is both fast enough to brake on and accurate enough to trust,
so there are three, and each is used only for what it is good at.

Tier 0 is the in-process estimate: data/firebase_guard.py counts operations and
bytes as the bot performs them. It is instant, and that is the only property a
brake really needs — a runaway retry loop has to be stopped in seconds. What it
cannot do is be right. It never sees a signed-URL download (those go straight
from the client to GCS), it cannot see bytes at rest, and it is blind to any
usage that isn't this process.

Tier 1 is Cloud Monitoring (data/gcp_metrics.py): Google's own measurements, so
it sees all three of those. It lags a few minutes, which makes it useless as a
trigger and ideal as the truth.

Tier 2 is the BigQuery billing export (data/gcp_billing.py): actual billed
dollars, net of free-tier credits, hours behind. It is the invoice, and it is
DISPLAY ONLY — `ingest_billing` writes somewhere the ladder never reads. A brake
fed by it would let a runaway spend for a whole export cycle first.

So tier 1 does not replace tier 0, it *corrects* it. `ingest_usage` adopts the
authoritative month-to-date counts as a new baseline and the local counters keep
running on top of it, so the effective figure is "Google's number, plus whatever
we've done since the last poll". The gap between the two tiers is kept and
reported as `drift`: it is the size of everything the wrapper cannot see, which
is a diagnostic worth having rather than an error to be hidden. Tier 2 sits
beside both as the answer key — where it disagrees with our modelled cost, the
error is in our price constants, and that gap is worth being able to see.

THE LADDER
----------
Enforcement used to be a single wall — under budget everything worked, over it
every Firestore call raised. That fails badly in practice: it takes the whole bot
down at once, with no warning beforehand and no way to run in a reduced mode.
Instead there are four levels (`Level`), driven by the fraction of budget spent:

  NORMAL    – nothing.
  WARN      – the owner is told, once. Everything still works.
  DEGRADED  – Storage *uploads* are refused; reads, downloads and all of
              Firestore keep working. Uploads are the expensive half and the
              most deferrable, so the bot stays fully usable and only new craft
              files are turned away.
  FROZEN    – the old hard stop: every Firestore and Storage operation raises
              `FirebaseBudgetExceeded`, after buffered writes are flushed.

Gemini is unchanged and always soft: over budget, `gemini_ok` is False and every
call site falls back to its heuristic.

STATE
-----
Persisted to LOCAL files, never to Firestore — the meter must keep working when
Firebase is the thing being cut off, and metering must not itself cost Firestore
operations. `data/cost_state.json` holds the live month; on rollover the closing
figures are appended to `data/cost_history.jsonl` so month-over-month growth is
visible before it becomes a surprise (the old version simply erased them).

The guard imports nothing from the bot except `settings`, so it is safe to
import from low-level modules like data/store.py without a circular import.
