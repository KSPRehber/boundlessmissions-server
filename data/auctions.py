"""
data/auctions.py – Firestore helpers for reverse (Dutch) auctions.

An auction is a contract whose price is bid DOWN by contractors. The lowest bid
when the auction closes wins and is converted into an active contract.
Documents live in the GLOBAL auctions/{auction_id} collection (auctions are
mirrored into every server); guild_id on the doc is the origin only.

    against the *committed* auction state inside a Firestore transaction.

    A plain read-then-update lets two near-simultaneous bids validate against the
    same `current_bid` and then race to write, so the later write wins even when it
    is a higher (worse) bid — the earlier, genuinely-lower bid is silently clobbered.
    Doing the ceiling check and the write in one transaction closes that: the ceiling
    is measured against whatever bid is actually committed at write time.

    Auctions are a Discord game: the winner is handed a work view in their corp
    channel or DM, and `close_auction` needs a member to do that. A website-only
    account (`a_…` id) has no such surface, so its bid is refused here — inside the
    storage function rather than only at the web endpoint — because a bidder the
    closer cannot resolve used to make the auction unclosable and hold the issuer's
    escrow forever.
