"""
cheat_check.py – Disqualify submissions whose vessels the KSP client flagged for
cheats (HyperEdit, VesselMover, the F12 cheat menu's Set Position / Set Orbit
and its cheat toggles).

The client is the only place this is knowable: a teleported vessel really *is*
at the target, so its telemetry is perfectly consistent and telemetry_check can
see nothing wrong — that check catches forged claims, this one catches cheated
truths. The mod's watchdog (KSP side: CheatDetection.cs) taints a vessel when
its flight state breaks physics continuity or a cheat tool/toggle is seen acting
on it — and likewise when the flight is a *simulation* (RP-1/KCT's "Simulate",
KRASH): a simulated launch is free, instant and reverted when it ends, so a
submission from inside one claims a flight that never happened. The client
refuses those outright before upload; the taint arriving here is the backstop
for a client that missed the memo. The submission carries a `cheat_report`
JSON covering exactly the vessels submitted.

Three shapes of report, three meanings — the distinction is the point:
  - report says tainted → disqualify (when the env gate is on)
  - report says clean   → checked and found clean
  - no report at all    → an older client that never checked; treated as clean,
    because a new server-side gate must not start rejecting existing clients
    (the convention every other submission field here follows).

`tools_installed` (HyperEdit merely present) is context for the reviewer and is
deliberately never a reason to reject: presence is not usage, and plenty of
players keep HyperEdit installed for sandbox testing while flying missions
clean.

Gated by cfg.KSP_CHEAT_DISQUALIFY_ENABLED (.env, default on), passed in by the
caller so this module stays import-light and unit-testable. Like every client-
reported field this is one layer of defense-in-depth, not an anti-cheat — a
modified DLL can simply not report, exactly as it could forge telemetry.
