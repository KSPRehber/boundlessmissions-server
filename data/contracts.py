    Uses two single-field-equality queries (each served by Firestore's automatic

    contract in the guild and OR-filtering in Python. The returned set is
    identical to the old `where("status","in",...).stream()` + Python filter,
    minus the status filter, which callers apply in-memory.

    Both keyword arguments default to the old behaviour — every contract the
    account has ever been party to — because the history view genuinely wants
    that. They exist for the callers that do not: a contract history only grows
    (a completed or cancelled contract is kept), so an unfiltered read is one
    metered Firestore read per contract the account has EVER had, on every call,
    and an endpoint that makes one per request turns a few thousand cheap
    create→cancel cycles into a walk up the shared budget to `cost_guard`'s
    FROZEN — which stops the bot for everybody, not for the caller. This is the
    same fix `count_active` already carries, and for the same reason.

      * `statuses` filters in the *query* (`status in [...]`), so the documents
        never leave Firestore and are never billed.
      * `limit` caps each of the two queries, so the read is bounded at 2×limit
        documents and the returned list at `limit`. It is a cost ceiling, not a
        page: there is no cursor, and a caller that hits it is seeing an
        arbitrary subset. Only pass it where a partial answer is better than an
        unbounded read (a summary line), never where it would silently change a
        total the player is shown as exact.
      * `roles` picks which side(s) to query. It exists because `limit` applies to
        EACH query and the merge then truncates to `limit` overall, keeping the
        first side's rows — so a caller that only cares about one side was paying
        its whole budget for rows it discards. `_escrow_held` wants issuer rows
        only; asking for both meant a player with a few hundred PENDING offers
        *made to them* (deliberately uncapped) filled the 500 with contractor rows
        and had their escrow reported low, or as zero.
