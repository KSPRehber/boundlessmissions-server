"""
data/firebase_guard.py – Metering + hard-stop wrappers for Firestore & Storage.

Every module that talks to Firestore imports the `_db` / `_storage_bucket`
handles from data/store.py. By wrapping those two handles here, the whole bot
is metered and gated in one place — no need to touch the 16 call-site modules.

The wrappers are recursive, transparent proxies:

  • On the happy path (Firebase under budget) they pass straight through, only
    incrementing the usage counters in cost_guard so spend can be estimated.
  • As the budget runs down they enforce cost_guard's ladder: at DEGRADED,
    `require_firebase(upload=True)` refuses new bytes into Storage while
    everything else keeps working; at FROZEN every network operation raises
    `FirebaseBudgetExceeded` (get/set/delete/commit, blob upload/download).

Uploads are singled out because they are the expensive, deferrable half: turning
away a new craft file leaves the bot wholly usable, whereas refusing reads takes
it down. That is the whole point of having a rung before the wall.

WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT SEE
A signed or public URL is downloaded by the client straight from GCS, so those
bytes never pass through this process and cannot be metered here — see
`generate_signed_url` below, which counts the *issuing* of such URLs as a
diagnostic and leaves the bytes to Cloud Monitoring (tier 1). This is the blind
spot the two-tier design exists for: the local meter reacts instantly to what it
can see, and Google's numbers close the gap on the next poll.

Counting is best-effort and must never raise; the gate is authoritative.
