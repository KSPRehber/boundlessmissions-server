data/gcp_billing.py – Tier 2: what Google actually charged.

The third and last source in the cost stack, and the only one denominated in
money rather than usage:

  • TIER 0 (cost_guard's own counters) — instant, an estimate, blind to anything
    that doesn't pass through this process. Drives the brake.
  • TIER 1 (data/gcp_metrics.py) — Cloud Monitoring. Google's usage figures, a
    few minutes behind. Corrects tier 0 and closes its blind spots.
  • TIER 2 (this file) — the BigQuery billing export. Actual billed dollars,
    net of free-tier credits, hours behind.

WHY THIS IS NOT ALLOWED TO DRIVE THE BRAKE
The export lands a few times a day. A brake fed by it would let a runaway spend
for a full export cycle before it could even see the problem — which is the
whole reason tiers 0 and 1 exist. So `ingest_billing` deliberately writes to a
display-only field: `cost_guard._billed`, which `snapshot()` reports and
`_level_locked()` never reads. Tier 2 is the receipt, not the trigger.

What it is uniquely good for is being *right*. Free-tier allowances arrive as
negative `credits` rows, so `cost + credits` is the true bill — no modelling of
daily quotas, no price constants, no guessing at regional rates. Where the
Costs tab shows a tier-1 estimate next to a tier-2 figure, the gap between them
is the error in our own pricing table, which is worth seeing.

SETUP (both are one-time, and until they exist this degrades to `ok=False`)
  1. Billing → Billing export → BigQuery export → Standard usage cost, pointed
     at a dataset. Data starts accruing from that moment; it never backfills.
  2. The service account needs `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` on the dataset and
     `roles/bigquery.jobUser` on the project. The Firebase key has neither by
     default — the Monitoring grant does not cover BigQuery.

Like data/gcp_metrics.py this speaks REST via google-auth + aiohttp rather than
pulling in `google-cloud-bigquery`, so it adds nothing to requirements.txt.
