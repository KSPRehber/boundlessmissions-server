"""
data/gcp_metrics.py – Authoritative usage figures from Cloud Monitoring.

cost_guard.py meters what the bot *does* — every Firestore call and every byte
uploaded through data/store.py. That estimate is instant, which is what makes it
usable as a breaker, but it is blind to three things by construction:

  • Egress from signed / public URLs. `store.signed_url` hands the client a link
    straight to GCS; the download is billed to us and never touches this process.
    That is the single largest and fastest-growing line item on the bill.
  • Bytes at rest. Storage is billed per GB-month on the total stored, which only
    ever goes up and which no amount of counting operations can reveal.
  • Anything that isn't the bot — scripts/backfill_*, the Firebase console, a
    second instance sharing the project.

Cloud Monitoring sees all of it, because it is metered by Google on their side.
It lags a few minutes rather than being instant, which is exactly the wrong
property for a breaker and exactly the right one for the truth. So this module
does not replace the local meter: it corrects it (see `cost_guard.ingest_usage`).

WHY RAW REST AND NOT google-cloud-monitoring
The official client would be a heavyweight new dependency, and a synchronous one
that every call would have to hop onto a thread. The Monitoring read API is a
single authenticated GET, and both halves of that are already installed:
`google-auth` (pulled in by firebase-admin) mints the token, `aiohttp` (already
a bot dependency) makes the call. So this file adds nothing to requirements.txt.

IAM
The service account in FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS needs `roles/monitoring.viewer` on
the project — Firebase does not grant it, so this is an explicit one-time grant
and until it happens every call here 403s. That is handled as a normal outcome
rather than an error: `UsageSnapshot.ok` is False, the reason is carried in
`.error`, and the cost guard keeps running on its local estimate alone.
