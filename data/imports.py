"""
data/imports.py – Per-user "craft import" queue.

When a player selects a craft for import in Discord (a completed bot-contract
craft via /library, or a craft they bought on the marketplace), an entry is
written here under that player's account. The KSP mod polls the pending queue
(see api_server.py /api/v1/craft/imports/...) and auto-imports each craft into
the active save, then acks it so the entry is deleted.

    The marketplace's two public uploaders were fixed to sniff and clamp; this one
    — the quicksend half of the same finding — was not, so `POST /craft/send` with
    an arbitrary `blueprint` stored world-readable attacker-chosen bytes on the

    on the ack of the import that consumes it, so an offer nobody answers keeps
    its blueprint forever). The hardcoded `image/png` closed the XSS half; nothing
    closed the file-hosting half.

    Refusing by returning None rather than raising is deliberate: the blueprint is
    the *preview* of a send, not the payload, and a craft that arrives without a
    picture is a far better outcome than a hand-over that 500s. The caller drops
    the field. The API layer still owns the byte cap and the bounded Pillow decode

    (installed to the Ships folder); "rescue_delivery" carries a vessel_node_url
    and is imported as a LIVE vessel (the rescued craft, spawned in-save); "flag"
    carries a flag_url (PNG) installed into the KSP Flags dir — never a
    craft/vessel. If an identical entry is already queued (same source + ref_id)
    the existing entry is returned instead of creating a duplicate.

    `status` is "queued" (the client auto-imports it) or "offered" (a friend
    quicksend awaiting the recipient's accept/decline — invisible to the
    auto-import poll until accepted). Offers carry the sender's `sender_id` so a
    decline can notify them, and a `blueprint_url` preview when the sender's
    client managed to render one.

    `vessel_pid` (gift_vessel and the rescue-cancel restore) is the vessel's pid
    in the SENDER's save. A quicksent live vessel is a hand-over — the sender's
    client removes it on send — so the pid rides both the offer (the accept
    notification echoes it, letting the sender's client re-queue a removal a
    quickload rolled back) and the decline-return entry (the sender's client
    uses it to cancel a removal that hasn't run yet instead of spawning a
    duplicate). A cancelled rescue's restore is the same return in contract
    shape, so it carries the issuer-save pid (`rescue_pid`) for the same check.

    `homebound` (gift_vessel only) is the server's attestation that some of the
    crew aboard are the RECIPIENT's own kerbals coming back to them — see
    `data/crew_ledger.py`. It is the quicksend equivalent of a rescue contract's
    `rescue_kerbals`, and the client passes it to
    `VesselTransfer.ApplyIncomingOwnershipTag` as the one list that may strip an
    incoming ownership tag. Absent (not empty) when nothing is attested: a client
    must be able to tell "nobody vouched for these" from "these are vouched for and
    the list is empty", because the first keeps the impersonation refusal and the
    second would be a promise nothing backs.
