"""
data/imports.py – Per-user "craft import" queue.

When a player selects a craft for import in Discord (a completed bot-contract
craft via /library, or a craft they bought on the marketplace), an entry is
written here under that player's account. The KSP mod polls the pending queue
(see api_server.py /api/v1/craft/imports/...) and auto-imports each craft into
the active save, then acks it so the entry is deleted.

    carries a flag_url (PNG) installed into the KSP Flags dir — never a

    the existing entry is returned instead of creating a duplicate.

    quicksend awaiting the recipient's accept/decline — invisible to the
    auto-import poll until accepted). Offers carry the sender's `sender_id` so a
    decline can notify them, and a `blueprint_url` preview when the sender's
    client managed to render one.

    `vessel_pid` (gift_vessel and the rescue-cancel restore) is the vessel's pid
    in the SENDER's save. A quicksent live vessel is a hand-over — the sender's
    client removes it on send — so the pid rides both the offer (the accept
    notification echoes it, letting the sender's client re-queue a removal a
    quickload rolled back) and the decline-return entry (the sender's client
    uses it to cancel a removal that hasn't run yet instead of spawning a
    duplicate). A cancelled rescue's restore is the same return in contract
    shape, so it carries the issuer-save pid (`rescue_pid`) for the same check.
