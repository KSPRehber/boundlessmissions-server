"""
data/marketplace.py – Firestore + Firebase Storage helpers for the craft marketplace.

A listing is a craft (.craft blueprint) a player put up for sale. Listings are
non-exclusive: buying one transfers KCoins to the seller and delivers the buyer a
copy of the blueprint, but the listing stays active so anyone else can buy it too.
Crafts are listed from the KSP mod's Market panel and bought on the website; Discord
is out of it entirely (see cogs/marketplace.py).

Firestore structure (GLOBAL — the marketplace spans every server):
    marketplace/{listing_id} → { ...listing fields..., guild_id (origin), mirrors }
    marketplace_votes/{user_id} → { votes: { listing_id: 1 | -1 } }
    marketplace_reports/{listing_id}_{reporter_id} → { ...one report... }
