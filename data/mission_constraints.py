"""
data/mission_constraints.py — Part-restriction ("mission limit") extraction & verification.

A contract's mission text can carry restrictions on what the craft is allowed to
use, e.g. "You must use a nuclear engine", "You can't use the Thud engine",
"Lqd He3 powered engines only", or "heatshield-less re-entry". This module turns
that natural-language text into a structured `constraints` dict, and verifies a
craft's actually-used parts (reported by the KSP client) against it.

The same canonical schema is enforced in three places:
  • the KSP editor (forbidden parts are hidden — see EditorPartEnforcer.cs)
  • the KSP submit gate (client-side pre-check — see SubmitWindow.cs)
  • the bot's /submit endpoint (authoritative re-check — see api_server.py)

Canonical constraints dict (every key optional; omitted/empty == no restriction):
    {
      "forbidden_parts":              [str],  # title substrings, e.g. "Thud"
      "required_parts":               [str],
      "forbidden_propellants":        [str],  # resource names, e.g. "LqdHe3"
      "required_propellants":         [str],
      "forbidden_engine_categories":  [str],  # semantic: nuclear/ion/solid/...
      "required_engine_categories":   [str],
      "forbidden_part_categories":    [str],  # e.g. "heatshield", "parachute"
      "required_part_categories":     [str],
      "max_parts":                    int,    # part-count ceiling (optional)
      "min_parts":                    int,    # part-count floor (optional)
      "max_dv":                       float,  # vacuum Δv ceiling, m/s (optional)
      "min_dv":                       float,  # vacuum Δv floor, m/s (optional)
      "max_crew":                     int,    # crew-aboard ceiling (optional)
      "min_crew":                     int,    # crew-aboard floor (optional)
      "crew_traits":                  {str: {"min": int, "max": int}},  # per-profession
      "notes":                        str,    # human-readable summary (optional)
    }

`crew_traits` is the same floor/ceiling idea applied per profession — "send two
pilots and a scientist" => {"Pilot": {"min": 2}, "Scientist": {"min": 1}}, "no
tourists" => {"Tourist": {"max": 0}}. Keys are canonical KSP trait names, spelled
exactly as `ProtoCrewMember.trait` holds them, because that string is what both
ends match on. That matters for modded professions (USI/MKS Kolonist, Miner,
Medic…): the trait string survives in a save even where the mod defining it is
absent, so matching by name works on any install — while a contract that asks for
a profession the contractor hasn't got is simply one they cannot fill, and the
violation message says so rather than pretending nobody was aboard.

Crew is stated as a floor, a ceiling, or both ("exactly N" == min_crew == max_crew).
`max_crew` is the one bound where **0 is a real value**, not "unset": an uncrewed
mission ("unmanned probe", "no kerbals aboard") is a ceiling of zero. Every read of
it therefore tests `is not None` rather than truthiness, and the KSP client uses -1
(not 0) as its "no limit" sentinel.

Δv (delta-v) is a whole-craft metric, so unlike the part rules it can't be
enforced by hiding parts in the editor. It's checked only at submit time: the
KSP client reports the craft's stock-calculated vacuum Δv and the bot verifies
it against max_dv/min_dv (the value is client-reported, like used_parts).
