data/mod_version.py – KSP mod version registry (Firestore).

Stores the published mod versions and which one is current under a single config
document (`config/mod_version`). The KSP client reports its DLL's SHA256; the
server matches it against the latest published hash to decide whether the client
must update.

    a security fix, a protocol change the server can no longer talk to — is what
    turns the grace window back on for everything under it. Marking it mandatory
    does NOT skip that window: the reason it exists (CKAN indexes and upgrades on
