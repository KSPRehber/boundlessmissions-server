        happily edited the in-memory record and marked it dirty — so the wallet

        While the freeze holds that is at least loud, because most Firestore-backed

        still lands in memory and is discarded at the next flush, while contracts
        settle COMPLETED in Firestore with the money never arriving.

    # ── Debt & garnishment ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
    #
    # An unpayable contract fine is not forgiven; the remainder is recorded as a debt
    # to the issuer and repaid out of a share of the debtor's later *earnings*. The
    # design notes that matter:
    #
    #  • **Earnings, not credits.** Garnishment is opt-in per call site
    #    (`garnishable=True`), never a blanket hook on `add_balance`. Roughly half of
    #    this codebase's credits are refunds and admin corrections — auction escrow
    #    coming back, a marketplace double-buy refund, an owner-console balance fix,
    #    and `/take`, which passes a *negative* amount. Skimming those would confiscate
    #    a player's own money. The default is therefore off, so a call site nobody
    #    flagged repays a debt slower rather than stealing from its owner.
    #
    #  • **The rate scales with the amount owed, not the number of creditors.** Owing
    #    two people a little is not worse than owing one person a lot, and a count-based
    #    rate is gameable from both ends — an issuer with an alt could split one
    #    contract in two to push a debtor into a higher bracket.
    #
    #  • **Splitting is pro-rata with a largest-remainder rule.** The wallet is an
    #    integer, so a naive share leaves dust that never clears and garnishes someone
    #    who has effectively paid; `DEBT_FORGIVE_BELOW` sweeps what is left.
    #
    #  • **A bot-issued contract has no creditor.** `_pay_issuer` already skips paying
    #    the bot ("no wallet to pay into"), so those debts carry `creditor_id == ""`:
    #    still collected, because the deterrent is the point, but paid to nobody.

    # ── Transaction ledger ───────────────────────────────────────────────
    #
    # Every movement of a wallet is recorded here, so a player can be shown what
    # they spent money on and what they earned it from. Four decisions shape it.
    #
    #  • **It lives on the user document**, as a capped list, rather than in a
    #    `transactions` subcollection. The store already buffers writes and flushes
    #    the whole record with `batch.set` every few minutes, so a ledger on the
    #    record rides that flush and costs **no additional Firestore write** — where
    #    a subcollection would cost one write per movement, on a project whose
    #    `cost_guard` exists because that bill is the thing being defended against.
    #    Reading a history is likewise the read the profile already does.
    #
    #  • **The list is a ring buffer and the totals are not.** A capped list is what
    #    keeps the document small (Firestore's limit is 1 MiB, and this record is
    #    rewritten in full on every flush), but a cap means old entries fall off the
    #    end — so a summary computed by summing the list would quietly start
    #    shrinking. `tx_totals` is therefore a set of running lifetime counters
    #    updated at the same moment, and it is what the summary and the category
    #    breakdown are built from; the list is only ever the recent detail.
    #
    #  • **The recorded amount is the delta that actually happened**, read off the
    #    balance either side of the change, never the amount the caller asked for.
    #    `add_balance` clamps at zero, so a deduction larger than the balance moves
    #    less than it was given — a ledger that recorded the request would fail to
    #    add up to the balance it claims to explain, which is the one property that
    #    makes it worth showing at all.
    #
    #  • **An untagged call is recorded, not dropped.** `category` defaults to
    #    OTHER rather than being required, so a call site nobody thought to tag
    #    shows up as an unexplained movement the player can still see, instead of
    #    a gap that makes the running total disagree with the wallet.
