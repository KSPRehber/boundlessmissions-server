"""
data/suspensions.py – temporary suspension from the mod/website services.

What this is *not*: a Discord ban. Kicks, bans and timeouts already exist in
`cogs/moderation.py` and act on guild membership. This acts on the API surface
instead — the KSP client and the website — which is the only place abuse of the
in-game features (bug-report spam, marketplace reports, contract griefing) can
actually be answered without throwing someone out of the community.

It is temporary by construction. Every record carries an expiry and there is no
"forever" value: a permanent removal is a Discord ban, a deliberate act with its
own audit trail, and dressing one up as a suspension that merely never ends would
hide it from both the player and the mod team. `MAX_HOURS` caps a single
suspension at a year.

Document shape (`suspensions/{user_id}`):

    {
        "user_id":    "123…",
        "reason":     "Filed 40 junk bug reports",   # shown to the player
        "by":         "owner#0",                     # who issued it
        "hours":      72,                            # as issued
        "created_at": "<iso8601>",
        "until":      1755600000.0,                  # epoch seconds — the truth
        "until_iso":  "<iso8601>",                   # display copy
        "lifted":     false, "lifted_at": …, "lifted_by": …
    }

Lifting sets `until` to now rather than deleting the document, so the history
survives and "is this user suspended" stays the single comparison `until > now`
on both the read path and the `list_active` query. Expiry needs no sweeper for
the same reason.

The read path runs on *every authenticated request*, so it is cached in-process
for `_CACHE_TTL` seconds — the same trick `api_auth._get_token_version` uses, and
for the same reason. Writers update the cache in place, so an admin's suspend or
lift takes effect on the next request rather than up to a TTL later. A cache
entry never outlives the suspension it describes: the TTL is clamped to the time
remaining, so a suspension that ends in 4 seconds is not enforced for 30.

A Firestore read failure fails **open** (nobody is suspended). The alternative —
treating an unreachable database as "suspended" — would lock every player out of
the mod during an outage, which is a far worse failure than a suspended player
getting a few extra minutes.
