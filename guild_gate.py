"""
guild_gate.py – the set of Discord guilds this bot is allowed to operate in.

Before this module existed there was no such set. `cfg.GUILD_IDS` looks like one
and is not: its only use is `bot._sync_commands`, which decides where slash
commands are *registered*. That is discoverability, not authority — it does not
stop the bot being added to a server, it does not cover prefix commands or
button/modal interactions, and left empty (the shipped `.env.example` default) it
syncs globally to every guild the bot is in. Nothing anywhere refused a guild:
there was no `on_guild_join`, no allowlist and no `leave()` in the codebase.

That mattered because the records the mod tier writes are **global**. A wallet is
`users/{user_id}` at the top level, guild-independent by design, and contracts
live in one collection — so an administrator of any server the bot happened to be
in passed `perms.is_mod_user` (which falls back to `kick_members or
administrator`) and could mint into the shared economy. `perms.moderatable_here`
bounds *who* they can act on; nothing bounded *which server they came from*.

The list is therefore **hardcoded below** rather than read from the environment.
An allowlist whose contents are configuration is one that an edit to `.env` — or
a `.env` that failed to load — can empty, and emptying this one silently restores
the hole. The environment may only ever *add* to it, never remove or replace.

Three enforcement points, and the split between them is deliberate:

  * **`on_guild_join` leaves immediately.** A guild we have just been added to
    holds nothing of ours — no corp channels, no tickets, no `guild_config` — so
    leaving costs nothing, and this is the exact case the module exists for.

  * **The boot sweep reports; it does not leave.** A guild we were *already* in
    when this landed may hold all of those things, and a restart that silently
    abandoned one would destroy state in a way the join case cannot. It logs
    loudly every time and leaves only when `GUILD_GATE_LEAVE_ON_BOOT` is set,
    which is a decision for a human rather than for a deploy.

  * **The interaction gate refuses regardless of presence.** This is what makes
    not-leaving safe — presence without service — and it is also what covers the
    window between a join and the leave call completing. It is applied at all
    three dispatch points (slash, button, modal), not just the command tree,
    because a view outlives the message it was sent on.

DMs are deliberately allowed through the interaction gate. A DM interaction is a
button on something the bot itself sent (the contract settle / more-time /
dispute hand-off), it carries no guild to check, and the authority behind it is
gated per command anyway — `perms.moderatable_here` already refuses the mod tools
outright in a DM. Refusing DMs here would break delivery, not close a hole.
