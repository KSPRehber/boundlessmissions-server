"""grant_all.py - give every existing player the same one-off amount of coins.

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A COMMAND
------------------------------
There is no bulk-grant surface in the bot: `/givemoney` and the console's
`admin_user_adjust` each move one wallet. This is the one-off, and it lives in
`scripts/` with the other migrations rather than becoming a slash command,
because a command that pays everybody is a command that can pay everybody twice.

IT REUSES THE STORE, IT DOES NOT REIMPLEMENT IT
-----------------------------------------------
The grant goes through `store.add_balance(..., category=TX_ADMIN)` and
`store.save()` — the same path `/givemoney` takes. Writing `balance` straight
into Firestore would land the coins and skip the transaction ledger, so the
Finance tab's history would no longer add up to the balance it claims to
explain, which is the one property that makes it worth showing.

NOT GARNISHABLE, DELIBERATELY
-----------------------------
`garnishable=True` marks a credit as *earnings*, from which an unpaid fine debt
is repaid. A blanket gift is an admin correction, not something the player
earned, and skimming it would take a gift straight to somebody else's wallet —
the same reason `/givemoney` does not pass the flag. `--garnishable` is there if
you decide otherwise, but the default is off.

THE BOT MUST BE STOPPED FIRST
-----------------------------
The running bot holds every user record in memory and flushes a dirty one with a
whole-document `set`. Write to Firestore underneath it and the grant survives
only for players who stay idle: anyone who earns XP, sells a craft or settles a
contract gets their record rewritten from the bot's stale memory, silently
reverting the coins for exactly the active players. So this refuses to run while
the public API answers. On the VPS:

    systemctl stop bm-bot
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/grant_all.py --apply
    systemctl start bm-bot

IDEMPOTENT, AND REVERSIBLE
--------------------------
Every grant carries a `--grant-id` (default: today's date) written into the
ledger entry's detail. A user whose ledger already shows that id is skipped, so
a re-run after a partial failure pays the remainder and nobody twice. Each run
writes a receipt to `scripts/grants/<grant-id>.json` recording every id and its
before/after, and `--revert <receipt>` takes back exactly what that run gave —
so this is undoable by the numbers rather than by memory.
