# ── Blueprint render scale ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The KSP mod renders vessel "blueprint" images at a fixed base size of
# 2048×1100 px, multiplied by this scale (SCALE=2 → 4096×2200). The server uses
# this value to derive a tight per-file upload cap for blueprint/screenshot
# uploads (see MAX_BLUEPRINT_BYTES in api_server.py), so a tampered client can't
# pad a render to the generic 25 MB cap and spray oversized uploads at the API.
#
# IMPORTANT: keep this in sync with `const int SCALE` in
# KSP Mod Side/GeneKerman/VesselRenderer.cs. If you raise the mod's SCALE,
# raise this too or legitimate renders will be rejected as too large.

# PNG is ~1 MB compressed and ~680 MB as RGBA, and Pillow's own default only
# starts to object at 89 MP. Every path that decodes user bytes (achievement /
# checkpoint photos, the avatar, the AI-review shrink, the flag watermark) reads
# the header first and refuses past this. A 4K screenshot is 8 MP and the largest
# blueprint render (4096×2200) is 9 MP, so 30 MP is room to spare, not a squeeze.
MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS = 30_000_000


# ── Cost Guard: paid-service spending caps ───────────────────────────────────
#
# The bot leans on two paid Google services: Gemini (AI screenshot/mission
# analysis) and Firebase (Firestore + Storage). cost_guard.py tracks monthly
# spend on each — to LOCAL files, never to Firestore — and degrades or cuts off
# a service as its budget is used up. Budgets reset on the 1st (UTC).
#
# There are two tiers of measurement, and they exist for different reasons:
#
#   • TIER 0 — the in-process estimate. Counted by data/firebase_guard.py as the
#     bot works. Instant, which is the only property that matters for a breaker:
#     a runaway retry loop has to be stopped in seconds, not at the next poll.
#     It is an estimate, and it can only see what goes through this process.
#   • TIER 1 — Cloud Monitoring (data/gcp_metrics.py). Google's own numbers, so
#     it also sees signed-URL egress, bytes at rest, and usage from scripts or
#     the console. Lags a few minutes, so it is the truth, not the trigger.
#
# Tier 1 corrects tier 0 rather than replacing it: `cost_guard.ingest_usage`
# adopts the authoritative counts and derives a drift ratio that scales the local
# estimate between polls. With no IAM grant (or COST_METRICS_ENABLED off) the
# guard runs on tier 0 alone, exactly as it did before.
#
# Enforcement is a ladder, not a wall — see cost_guard.Level:
#   NORMAL → WARN (owner is told) → DEGRADED (Storage uploads shed, the
#   expensive and least essential work) → FROZEN (hard stop, after a flush).
# Gemini degrades softly at every level: it falls back to heuristics.
#
# Set a budget to 0 (or negative) to mean "unlimited" — that service is never
# capped. The values below are the defaults; each can be overridden in .env.

# The clock is absolute from the moment the dispute opened and does NOT pause for a

# to actively agree to it in time. One exception, which is not a pause: a request

# the dispute grace path escalates here — and nothing would ever happen again. Every
# transition out of MOD_REVIEW is refused, so the issuer's escrow and a contract slot for
# both parties were locked until a moderator acted, forever if none did.
#
# It times out to the SAME outcome as an unanswered dispute (the fine collects) rather
# than to a neutral cancel, and that direction is the whole point: if suing and waiting

# ── Mod version gate: the grace window ───────────────────────────────────────
#
# Read this second. The window only ever runs for a build that a MANDATORY release
# outranks — publishing a new version no longer starts a clock on the old one by
# itself, it just tells its holders an update exists (see data/mod_version.py's
# `acceptance`). So this number is not "how long may a player be behind"; it is
# "how long do they get once we have decided they may not stay where they are".
#
# The gate is what forces a player onto the current build, and CKAN is what we
# recommend they update *with*. Those two facts don't compose on their own: NetKAN
# indexes a release on its own schedule and the player still has to open CKAN, so
# between a publish and an upgrade being *offered* there is a lag we neither control
# nor observe. Gating hard on `latest_hash` alone turns that lag into a lockout, and
# makes a tool we don't run a hard dependency of every login.
#
# So a build that was the published latest until recently is still accepted — told
# it is out of date, never refused; and one with nothing mandatory above it is
# accepted for as long as that holds, with no clock at all. The window is measured from when the build
# STOPPED being latest (`superseded_at`), not from when it was published: that is the
# moment the player's copy became stale, it chains correctly across a rapid A→B→C
# (A ages out on B's clock, not C's), and it cannot be gamed by an old build simply
# because a new one shipped today.
#
# Grace is only ever extended to a hash we ourselves published. An unknown hash — a
# modified DLL, which is the thing the gate exists for — is refused exactly as before.
#
# 0 disables the window, so a build a mandatory release outranks is refused at once
# (an unforced build is still accepted — the flag decides that, not this number).

# How many votes a listing needs before its score is allowed to move it in the

# MARKETPLACE_AUTO_DELIST_MIN_VOTES before it will remove a craft; the sorts had
# no such requirement, so a handful of fresh accounts could put a listing at the
# top of the site's default discovery tab. Below this a listing still appears —
# it simply ranks as unrated rather than as acclaimed.
# How much agreement a listing needs before its score counts at face value in the
# "highest rated" and "recommended" sorts. NOT a threshold: a hard cliff at the
# removal quorum (40) switched the sorts off altogether, because no craft on a
# market this size ever collects forty votes — every listing scored 0 and the
# landing tab silently became "Newest". This is the `k` in `net * votes/(votes+k)`,
# so a craft with k votes counts at half its score and one with 4k at 80%: enough
# damping that a handful of alt upvotes is worth a fraction of face value, with no

# backstop — keep it high enough that normal traffic on a shared public IP can
# never trip it, or one attacker flooding the endpoint locks every player out of
# linking (a self-inflicted DoS). 600/min is still <0.2% of the code space per

# and eccentricity are bound by pure geometry (no GM needed, so these hold on any
# rescaled install). data/telemetry_check.py re-derives those identities on submit
# and catches a snapshot whose numbers don't add up. See data/telemetry_check.py.
#
# Mode controls what a violation does:
#   "reject_and_flag" – hard (impossible) violations reject the submission AND open
#                       a moderator suspicion; soft (body-radius) ones only flag.
#   "flag_only"       – never reject; record a suspicion for mods to review.
